    "##### **Agentic AI (in short):**\n",
    "**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems designed to act as **autonomous agents** that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Perceive** their environment (input or context)\n",
    "* **Plan** actions or strategies\n",
    "* **Act** toward goals without constant human guidance\n",
    "* **Adapt** based on feedback or new information\n",
    "    * **Transformer** = brain (language understanding)\n",
    "    *  **Agentic AI** = brain + planner + decision-maker\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Traits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal-directed:** Operates with a specific objective or mission.\n",
    "* **Autonomous:** Can make decisions and take actions on its own.\n",
    "* **Interactive:** May collaborate or negotiate with users or other agents.\n",
    "* **Iterative reasoning:** Thinks in steps, often using tools or memory.\n"
